# Smart Contract Audits: Key Concepts & Best Practices

## 1. What is a Smart Contract Audit?

It's important to clarify that what's commonly referred to as a "smart contract audit" is more accurately described as a **security review**. The term "audit" often implies a silver bullet solution or a guarantee of bug-free code, which is not the case. A security review is simply a detailed examination of the code and protocol for vulnerabilities.

### Sample Review Process:

A typical security review process might look like this:

1. **Submit Commit Hash:** The client provides the specific version of the code (via a commit hash) to be reviewed.
2. **Initial Report:** The audit firm delivers a report classifying identified issues by **severity** (critical, high, medium, low, informational) and sometimes efficiency concerns.
3. **Protocol Fix:** The development team addresses the identified issues and implements fixes.
4. **Final Report:** The audit firm re-evaluates the fixes and issues a final report, often detailing the remediation status.
5. **Post-Audit:** While the final report is issued, it's crucial to understand that **fixed code is not automatically "audited."** Any significant changes require further review or a new audit.

### Must-Haves for a Successful Review:

For a security review to be effective, several elements are crucial:

- **Clear Documentation:** Comprehensive and up-to-date documentation explaining the protocol's design, architecture, and functionalities.
- **Robust Test Suite:** A strong suite of tests, ideally including **fuzz testing**, to validate the contract's logic under various conditions.
- **Commented & Readable Code:** Well-commented, clean, and easily understandable code.
- **Modern Best Practices:** Adherence to current Solidity and smart contract development best practices.
- **Open Communication Channel:** Effective communication between the development team and the auditors.
- **Initial Video/Walkthrough:** An initial video or live walkthrough by the development team to explain the protocol's intricacies.
- **Post-Audit Strategy:** Understanding that security is an ongoing process, requiring continuous attention even after the initial review.

### Types of Audits:

There are generally two main types of security reviews:

- **Competitive Audit:** Publicly open, allowing multiple security researchers or teams to participate and identify vulnerabilities, often with a reward system.
- **Private Audit:** Conducted confidentially by a hired firm, ensuring client privacy and often a more in-depth, dedicated engagement.

## 2. The Audit Process (Three Phases)

A comprehensive security review typically involves three distinct phases:

1. **Initial Review & Scoping:**
    - **Reconnaissance:** Understanding the protocol's purpose, design, and attack surface.
    - **Vulnerability Identification:** Thoroughly searching for security flaws.
    - **Reporting:** Documenting all findings, their severity, and recommendations.
2. **Protocol Fixes:**
    - The development team implements fixes for the reported issues.
    - They typically add new tests to cover the fixed vulnerabilities.
3. **Mitigation Review:**
    - This phase involves a re-evaluation of the applied fixes.
    - It often requires repeating elements of the initial review, reinforcing the idea that **"repetition is the mother of skill"** in security.

## 3. The "Rekt Test"

The "Rekt Test" is a series of questions designed to determine if a protocol is truly ready for a security audit. It's a **pre-audit checklist** to ensure fundamental security practices are in place during development.

### Key Questions:

1. Do you have all actors, roles, and privileges documented?
2. Do you keep documentation of all the external services, contracts, and oracles you rely on?
3. Do you have a written and tested incident response plan?
4. Do you document the best ways to attack your system?
5. Do you perform identity verification and background checks on all employees?
6. Do you have a team member with security defined in their role?
7. Do you require hardware security keys for production systems?
8. Does your key management system require multiple humans and physical steps?
9. Do you define key **invariants** for your system and test them on every commit?
10. Do you use the best automated tools to discover security issues in your code?
11. Do you undergo external audits and maintain a vulnerability disclosure or bug bounty program?
12. Have you considered and mitigated avenues for abusing users of your system?

## 4. Post-Deployment Planning

Security doesn't end after deployment. A robust **Smart Contract Development Cycle** must include a strong post-deployment plan, covering:

- **Bug Bounty Programs:** Incentivizing ethical hackers to find and report vulnerabilities.
- **Disaster Recovery Drills:** Practicing responses to potential exploits or system failures.
- **Monitoring:** Continuously observing contract activity and network health for anomalies.

## 5. Security Tools

Various tools aid in smart contract security:

- **Framework Testing:** Basic unit and integration testing provided by development frameworks like **Foundry** and **Hardhat**.
- **Static Analysis:** Tools that analyze code **without executing it**, identifying potential issues through pattern matching (e.g., **Slither**).
- **Fuzz Testing & Stateful Fuzz Testing:** As discussed earlier, these techniques test contract logic with varied inputs.
- **Formal Verification:** Applying rigorous mathematical methods to prove the correctness of hardware or software. This involves converting code into mathematical models (e.g., via **symbolic execution**) to verify properties.
- **AI Tools:** While in 2023 their effectiveness for complex bug detection was limited, their capabilities are rapidly advancing in 2025 and are worth continuous exploration. You must always explore new tools and continuously learn!

**Reference:** [Web3Bugs - ZhangZhuoSJTU](https://github.com/ZhangZhuoSJTU/Web3Bugs)

- In 2023, only about 20% of reported bugs were considered "machine auditable." While AI tools are improving, **incorrect business logic remains a significant challenge** for automated detection.

## 6. If a Protocol You Audited Gets Hacked

If a protocol that underwent your security review is later exploited, it's crucial to remember that **security is a continuous journey**, not a one-time destination.

- Hacks are often the result of multiple factors, and it's rarely solely the fault of a single audit.
- It's important to support your client to maintain a good relationship and reputation, but you are part of a larger team committed to making the protocol safe.

## 7. Top Attack Vectors

Understanding common attack vectors is essential for both developers and auditors:

While the Cointelegraph article suggests a shift in hacker focus towards user-centric attacks (e.g., phishing, social engineering) in 2025, **code vulnerabilities remain a significant problem**. Developers must stay vigilant against both technical and social vectors.
